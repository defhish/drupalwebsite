Dear Sir,Please find below the aspects pertaining to my activities over the day:

Highlights of the Day:

Successfully enabled and configured the email functionality in the local Drupal environment.

Implemented automatic email notifications to the admin (admin1@gmail.com) whenever a new feedback form is submitted.

The email contains a direct link to the admin approval interface, with logic to redirect non-logged-in users to the login page first.

Verified email delivery and ensured admin and user emails are triggered appropriately on feedback submission and status update (approve/reject).


Lowlights of the Day:

Initial confusion and delay while setting up the email system due to local environment limitations.

Minor issues with redirect logic which required additional adjustments to ensure proper user flow.

Obstacles Faced Over the Day:

Took some time to figure out how to get email notifications working properly in the local development environment.

Had to troubleshoot redirect issues to make sure users who arenâ€™t logged in are sent to the login page before accessing admin pages
